		<h2>Direct Download</h2>
		<p>Thank you for your interest in helping out with drop rate data!</p>
		<div class="wrapper majorContainer">
			<a href="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1741" target="_blank"><img src="images/misc/esoui.png" alt="Crown Crate Tracker direct download"></a>
			<p>
				You can <a class="textLink" href="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1741" target="_blank">download the addon directly from ESOUI</a>, the main hub for all elder scrolls online addons.
				There, you can find Crown Crate Tracker's change log, browse an archive of previous updates, and participate in the discussion by leaving comments.
				Once you've downloaded the addon, you will need to open the zip file and drag the CrownCrateLogger folder out and into your <span class="common">Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns</span> directory.
				After that, the addon should appear in-game.
				If it does not, you may need to type in the /reloadui chat command.
				From there, all you have to do is open crown crates normally. Crown Crate Tracker will handle the rest.
			</p>

		<h2>Addon Manager</h2>
		<p>Get new versions with improvements as they become available!</p>
		<div class="wrapper majorContainer">
			<a href="https://www.minion.gg/?details" target="_blank"><img src="images/misc/minion.png" alt="Crown Crate Tracker manager download"></a>
			<p>
				Alternatively, you may <a class="textLink" href="https://www.minion.gg/?details" target="_blank">download Minion instead</a>, and get Crown Crate Tracker from there.
				Minion is ESOUI's addon manager.
				It allows you to find and install any addon from within its interface.
				It also notifies you when new updates for your addons are released.
				It takes care of everything for you.
				I strongly recommend using this desktop program for managing your addons.
